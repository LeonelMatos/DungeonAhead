# Dungeon Ahead!

*Version 0.1.3*

The 2D top-view story game with an open world to explore and listen to the many tales the
vast land has to tell.

The main concept of this game is to explore: playing as an adventurer/explorer you'll find
different quirky characters, each having their own story (still considering).

The game will contain different items that will aid you on your quest. Speaking of quests:
there will be plenty of them.

## Notice
Dungeon Ahead! as of this update **0.1.3** still lacks content such as story, combat mechanics,
textures, levels and many other features that are still stashed away in a *TODO* list.

Doing this project on my own is not an easy task and requires hard-work, that is why I do this
project with entretainment and educational purposes only. If something worth playing comes
out of this, I may reconsider my plans.
